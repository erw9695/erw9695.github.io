            When analyzing art, John Berger describes the ways in which its meanings and interpretation can vary dramatically.	Once such a way he describes is with the development of cameras and digital image production.  Berger describes that cameras have made paintings more easily transmissible and as a result alters its meaning depending on how the reproduction is used.  I find that the use of modern technology to alter how an art piece is viewed is beneficial.  While an artist may have one intended meaning for an art piece, a different viewer will always have varying opinions and ideas about the same piece of art.  Cameras are just a tool for the alteration of an art piece’s meaning and for amplifying how many people can develop a meaning for the art piece.  It alone did not give us the power to change the meaning of an art piece as that power always existed.

            Berger also goes into the uses of oil paintings and advertisements.  He describes oil paintings as “a medium to celebrate private possessions” and advertisements as just a continuation of this in the modern era.  What I find interesting is that he views the message presented by advertisements to be equal to that of oil paintings depicting wealth and fortunes even though they were created with two dramatically different mediums.  The technology used to create modern advertisements are dramatically different from those used to create oil paintings.  What this demonstrates is that modern technology can be equally effective as works of art in communicating a complex message.  Art over time has just changed in how it's depicted and not necessarily in its meaning.
