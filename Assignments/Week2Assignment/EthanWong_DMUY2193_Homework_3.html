            In his article, Bush details his opinion on how technology may advance sometime into the 
            future.  Bush leads by discussing the rapid innovation by scientists during World War II to
             illustrate the potential for rapid innovation in peacetime.  Bush then goes into ways he 
             sees technology can be improved.  He discusses ways photography can be more efficient.  
             Bush describes a new way of record-keeping by voice rather than with a keyboard.  
             He envisions calculation machines for logical processes that don’t follow established 
             arithmetic conventions.  Bush later goes into a device he calls a “memex”, which would 
             allow for the rapid access of records, books, and communications.  He envisions the device 
             would allow the user to create associations between records and that memex records created 
             by one person could be used by many others on their memex.

            The improvements described by Bush are largely seen today with computers.  Voice-based 
            record keeping is readily available with speech recognition software.  Artificial 
            intelligence and machine learning technologies essentially allow for the calculation of 
            logical processes he describes.  The description of a memex is essentially what a modern 
            day computer achieves.  They even have similar designs as he envisioned a memex to be a 
            “slating translucent screen” with a keyboard.  The accessibility of memex records he 
            describes is accomplishable with the internet.  In many ways, most of Vannevar Bush’s 
            predictions of the future have come true.
