"So successful has been the camera’s role in beautifying the world that
photographs, rather than the world, have become the standard
of the beautiful"
Instead of paintings of seeing, photographs are the way to see now the way. Because
they are more beautiful than the physical world

“photographic seeing,” which was both a
new way for people to see and a new activity for them to perform"
Instead of looking, photographs

"[Photographs] changed seeing itself, by fostering the idea
of seeing for seeing’s sake. ... Observation ... [acquired] the stature of moral duty"
The vanity of photographs is that there is no deeper meaning for photographing. They just
want to photograph for the sake of photographing

"But photographic seeing has to
be constantly renewed with new shocks, whether of subject matter
or technique, so as to produce the impression of violating ordinary
vision"
The beauty of photographs is not from the essence of photographs themselves, but because
they are able to capture beauty and distort it, make it something never before seen.

" 'I want it to
be an altogether new object, complete and self-contained, whose
basic condition is order.' "
Creating an object out of beauty

" As
Wittgenstein argued for words, that the meaning is the use—so
for each photograph "
The beauty of context is lost, only sense used is sight.
